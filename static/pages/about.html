            <div class="line">Takedown Observer is an open dataset that documents which accounts have been withheld at the country-level from the X/Twitter platform in response to legal takedown orders from various countries.</div>
            
            <div class="line">This research tool seeks to uncover the extent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-blocking" class="inline-link">geo-blocking</a>, wherein a website utilises a visitor’s geographic location to withhold access to certain content available elsewhere.</div>

            <div class="line">The data is collected through an accompanying browser extension, which automatically detects if an account is withheld in a particular country when a user encouters a block page. This information is available through X’s <a href="https://blog.x.com/developer/en_us/a/2012/new-withheld-content-fields-api-responses" class="inline-link">API</a> which shows when an account has been withheld in response to a government order and lists the countries that are affected. The extension reports blocked accounts to a database that is made openly available through this website.</div>
        
            <div class="line">The browser extension is recommended for use by researchers looking to quickly confirm and collate user reports of account takedowns on X and is available on <a href="https://github.com/takedown-observer/extension" class="inline-link">Github</a>.</div>

            <div class="line">Takedown Observer is a project of the <a href="https://irl.works" class="inline-link">internet Research Lab</a>. It was developed by Divyank Katira with support from ARTICLE 19's Internet of Rights Fellowship.</div>
